This script formats the A and B dat files so they can be plotted
in GNUPLOT and curve fit to find the characteristic curve for the
detectors.

Step1.  Extract the A and B data from the log file using testgrafix>fileover>export excel
Step2.  There will be to CSV files one for A and one for B.  They must have
names of the form *A.dat and *B.dat
Step3.  Put the dat files in teh same directory as makeplot.scr
Step4.  Run makeplot.scr
Step5.  This will process the data making a newfile called plba
	that contains the minA and maxA for each B
Step6.  The curve fit plot is plba.png and the histogram is histo.png
Additional gnuplot commands

f(x) = a2*x*x+a1*x+a0
fit [from:to] f(x) "plba" via a2, a1, a0
plot 'plba', f(x)
set title "Calibration Curve N149Z March 23, 2012"
set xlabel "B channel counts" 0,0
set xrange [0:600]
f(x) = a2 * x * x + a1 * x + a0
a2 = whatever
a1 = whatever
a0 = whatever
set label "whatever" 
save 'plot.plt'
replot
set label "whatever" at 1,2
print a2
set label 1 sprintf("a2 = %e", a2) at -1000, -3750
unset label 1
set term png size 950, 600
set output "calibration_curve.png"
set term pop #restores terminal to startup
